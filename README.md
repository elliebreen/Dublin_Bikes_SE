The DBikes application provides an informative and engaging platform for Dublin Bikes. The aim of the application is to help users find the best station to rent and return a bike. It offers the user an interactive platform whereby they can visualise the availability for stations, the weather and historical data for stations. The predictions page provides a predictive availability value, based on hour, day and weather. This will allow users to make smarter decisions on where and when to rent a DBike.
